# Vehicle_detection
A python application used for detecting cars, vans, motorcycles, buses, threewheels, and trucks using Yolov8 for training and detection and pyqt5 for GUI.
For the training of the model, I've used kaggle dataset which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nadinpethiyagoda/vehicle-dataset-for-yolo/).
## Installation
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/husseinkhaled733/Vehicle_detection.git
